# MandatoryActivity3

**Here is our implementation of Mandatory Activity 3**

Assuming you are at the root of the program, do the following:

Step 1 to set up the server: 
- Open a terminal
- Run: go run server/server.go

Step 2 to set up a client:
- Open a new terminal
- Run: go run client/participant.go

To add more clients, repeat step 2
